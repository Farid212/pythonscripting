Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string.

In those instances you will use the `str()` method. Here's an example:

```py
n = 256
n = str(n)
```

## The challenge:

Create a file named `number-to-string.py`.

In that file define a variable named `n` that references the number `128`;

Call the `str()` method on the `n` variable.

Use `print()` to print the results of the `str()` method to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify number-to-string.py
```
