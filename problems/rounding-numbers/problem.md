We can do basic math using familiar operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.

For more complex math, we can use the `round()` method.

In this challenge we'll use the `round()` object to round numbers.

## The challenge:

Create a file named `rounding-numbers.py`.

In that file define a variable named `roundUp` that references the float `1.5`.

We will use the `round()` method to round the number up. This method rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.

An example of using `round()`:

```py
round(0.5)
```

Define a second variable named `rounded` that references the output of the `round()` method, passing in the `roundUp` variable as the argument.

Use `print()` to print that number to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify rounding-numbers.py
```
