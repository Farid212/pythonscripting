You will often need to know how many characters are in a string.

For this you will use the `len()` property. Here's an example:

```py
example = 'example string'
len(example)
```

## NOTE

The above code will return a **number** for the total number of characters in the string.


## The challenge:

Create a file named `string-length.py`.

In that file, create a variable named `example`.

**Assign the string `'example string'` to the variable `example`.**

Use `print()` to print the **length** of the string to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify string-length.py
```
