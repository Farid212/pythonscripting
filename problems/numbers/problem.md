Numbers can be integers, like `2`, `14`, or `4353`, or they can be decimals,  
also known as floats, like `3.14`, `1.5`, or `100.7893423`.
Unlike Strings, Numbers do not need to have quotes, unless you declare it this way:

```py
w = float('1.25')
```
or 
```py
x = int('25')
```

otherwhise & in most case you will use:

```py
y = 125
```
and
```py
z  = 1.25
```


## The challenge:

Create a file named `numbers.py`.

In that file define a variable named `example` that references the integer `123456789`.

Use `print()` to print that number to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify numbers.py
```
