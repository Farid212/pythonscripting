Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

Here is an example:

```py
foodPreferences = {
    pizza = 'yum'
    salad = 'gross'
}
```

## The challenge:

Create a file named `objects.py`.

In that file, define a class named `Pizza` like this:

```py
pizza = {
    'toppings': ['cheese', 'sauce', 'pepperoni'],
    'crust': 'deep dish',
    'serves': 2
}
```

Use `print()` to print the `pizza` object to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify objects.py
```
