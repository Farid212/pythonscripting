An array is a list of values. Here's an example:

```py
pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'bird']
```

### The challenge:

Create a file named `arrays.py`.

In that file define a variable named `pizzaToppings` that references an array that contains three strings in this order: `tomato sauce, cheese, mushroom`.

Use `print()` to print the `pizzaToppings` array to the terminal.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify arrays.py
```
