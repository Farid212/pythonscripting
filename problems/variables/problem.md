A variable is a name that can reference a specific value. Variables are declared using the variable's name.

Here's an example:

```py
hello = 'hello world'
```

# NOTE 

Python has no command for **declaring** a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

## The challenge:

Create a file named `variables.py`.

In that file declare a variable named `example`.

**Make the variable `example` equal to the value `'some string'`.**

Then use `print()` to print the `example` variable to the console.

**Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:**

```bash
pythonscripting verify variables.py
```
